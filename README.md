Css Exercise
============

Basic exercise where I take a mock image and create a working html prototype. A good way to brush up some css skills!

## The Stack
* [Mimosa](http://www.mimosa.io) - Maybe a bit heavy for this small project but it only took a few commands to get up and running with compilation, linting and live reload in the browser
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - I didn't need any of the templating functionality but the syntax is so much nicer to work with than html and it takes 2 seconds to get mimosa to generate static html files from jade.
* Less
* Bootstrap 3

## To build
* `npm install`
* `.\make start`
* browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Don't do
* I added all my less directly to `app.less` but on a larger app I would have separated it out to directories for base, layout, modules and so on and separted modules into indivdual files.
* I would have setup minification for a real app
